        <p>Upon agreement to this Terms of Use, you will receive access to the <b>Kaplan Nursing Integrated Testing Faculty User Guide</b>. The Integrated Tests are intended to assist faculty and administrators in ascertaining students’ strengths and weaknesses in recalling and understanding nursing knowledge and in applying this knowledge in clinical situations. Test results enable nursing school faculty at the end of a program to identify a student’s knowledge and learning deficits in specific content area.</p>
        <p>As noted in the guide, and in accordance with the industry’s Fair Testing standards, Kaplan Nursing recommends that the Integrated Tests not be used as the sole criteria for progression in or graduation from a nursing program, but considered one of several indicators of students’ accomplishments in basic nursing.</p>
