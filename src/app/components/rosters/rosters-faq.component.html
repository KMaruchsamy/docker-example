        <div class="collapse" [class.in]="visiblefaq1" id="faq1">
          <p>
            All students enrolled in the Kaplan program are activated by the
            submission of rosters to your school’s dedicated Account Manager
            <ng-template [ngIf]="accountManagerId">
              ,
              <b> {{ accountManagerFirstName }} {{ accountManagerLastName }}</b>
              (
              <a href="mailto:{{ accountManagerEmail }}">{{
                accountManagerEmail
              }}</a
              >) </ng-template
            >. The rosters tell us which students to activate and classify them
            into cohorts labeled by month and year of graduation (e.g. June
            2017). Based on their cohort, students are granted access to the
            Kaplan program for three months after graduation, which typically
            covers their NCLEX® testing cycle.

            To submit a new student roster please download our

            As students are entered into the Kaplan system, they are emailed a
            user name and password that provides them with access to all the
            resources they will utilize in conjunction with the Kaplan program.

            To submit a request for a roster change or update, click on the
            “Request change or update” link within the appropriate cohort
            roster. You can ask your Account Manager to make the following
            changes or updates:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet paragraph-spacing-bottom-list">
            <li>
              Move a student to a different cohort or move a student from a
              different cohort to the current cohort (for example, if the
              student’s graduation date has changed).
            </li>
            <li>
              Make a student in the current cohort inactive (for example, if the
              student has withdrawn for the semester or left the school).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a new student to the current cohort to enable access to Kaplan
              resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Request untimed versions of Kaplan tests for students in the
              cohort needing testing accommodations. When a student is set to
              ADA status, his/her tests will be untimed.  Before beginning a
              test, the student should see an <b>"UNTIMED"</b> stamp next to
              scheduled Integrated Tests, Focused Review, and NCLEX prep resources.
              If the student sees a <b>"TIMED"</b> stamp, he/she should NOT begin
              the test and alert the proctor that he/she is not receiving extended time.
              <ul>
                <li>Once the test starts, the student should NOT see a timer. </li>
                <li>If the student sees a timer when beginning the exam, the student should end the test immediately because he/she is not receiving extended timing.</li>
                <li>Since ADA status makes tests untimed, it is up to the proctor to ensure the student receives the correct amount of time based on their specific accommodations.</li>
                <li>The proctor should actively monitor the timing for each student and be aware of their official accommodations.</li>
                <li>*Please note that ADA status affects all future Integrated Tests for marked students. The designation only has to be made once. There is no need to designate again for future tests. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              If a student needs additional time to access the Kaplan resources
              beyond their end date (three months after graduation), students
              can purchase additional increments of time by contacting our
              Student Support Team at 877-572-8457. Students who are not
              successful on their first attempt at the NCLEX® can apply for the
              Partnership Extension and, if eligible, receive an additional
              three months of access at no additional cost.
