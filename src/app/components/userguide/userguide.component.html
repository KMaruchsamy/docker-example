                        <p>Students who are designated as needing accommodations during testing sessions will receive untimed versions 
                        of their tests. To request extended test timing, please click "Manage Cohorts" from the main menu of the 
                        Faculty Site. Select the cohort these students are in and select "Request Change or Update". Check the box next 
                        to the students you want that status activated on and click "Review summary of changes/updates". That will 
                        submit the request to your Account Manager and will mark the student in the Kaplan system as having ADA status.
                        When students are set to ADA status, once their Integrated test times down to 0, a pop-up window will appear 
                        telling them they can continue. After students click the “OK” button in the pop-up, their test will become untimed. 
                        It is up to the proctor to ensure that ADA students receive the correct amount of time for which they are eligible. 
                        Therefore, the proctor will need to be actively monitoring the timing for those students and aware of what their 
                        official accommodations are.</p>

                        <p>Integrated Tests benchmark student progress during nursing school. The test items cover
                            the key concepts and major topics taught in a basic nursing curriculum. The tests assess
                            the ability of students to use the components of the nursing process within major
                            content and conceptual areas. The tests strategically include questions of varying
                            difficulty levels to assess students’ ability to apply the nursing process to client
                            needs, problems, and frequently encountered situations. Constructs, such as critical
                            thinking and making nursing judgments, are essential themes embedded in all tests. The
                            tests are designed to challenge basic nursing students and provide feedback regarding
                            students’ ability to recall information, understand concepts, set priorities, and make
                            nursing judgments.
                        </p>
                        <p>The <b>Integrated Tests</b> are developed by groups of nursing faculty selected by Kaplan
                            Nursing. After development, each Integrated Test is reviewed by a panel of nursing
                            faculty to determine the degree to which the items on the test reflect a course’s
                            content domain. The panel makes changes to the Integrated Test as needed to make the
                            tests reflective of a basic nursing curriculum leading to licensure.
                        </p>
                        <p>To ensure the usefulness and effectiveness of the tests as evaluation tools, Kaplan
                            Nursing conducts research studies to determine the reliability and validity of the
                            tests. In these studies, Kaplan Nursing administers the RN Integrated Tests to students
                            enrolled in associate degree (ADN) and baccalaureate degree (BSN) nursing programs and
                            administers the PN Integrated Tests to groups of practical nursing and vocational
                            nursing students. A small number of students enrolled in nursing diploma programs
                            participate in the RN study. The schools of nursing participating in the study are
                            geographically dispersed across the United States. Kaplan Nursing makes every effort to
                            ensure that the sample that participates in the study accurately represents the
                            population of students enrolled in nursing schools.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Integrated Tests are administered by the faculty of the nursing schools under
                            proctored conditions. Nursing faculty monitor the security of the test questions.
                            Because the tests are designed to be used for evaluation rather than as teaching tools,
                            traditional explanations of the correct and incorrect answers for the Integrated Tests
                            are not distributed to students or faculty. Instead, remediation explanations are
                            provided for each test question.
                        </p>
                        <p>Repeat analysis of data from the Integrated Tests has shown that results are similar to
                            the results from the previous studies. This suggests that the Integrated Tests are
                            stable and reliable instruments. The Integrated Tests continue to be monitored for
                            quality and updated as needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Integrated Tests are intended to assist faculty and administrators in ascertaining
                            students’ strengths and weaknesses in recalling and understanding nursing knowledge and
                            in applying this knowledge in clinical situations. In addition, a significant number of
                            questions require students to apply critical thinking skills to make sound nursing
                            judgments within the purview of a basic nursing course or program. Test results enable
                            nursing school faculty at the end of the program to identify a student's knowledge and
                            learning deficits in specific content areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>In accordance with the industry's Fair Testing standards, Kaplan Nursing recommends that
                            the Integrated Tests not be used as the sole criteria for progression in or graduation
                            from a nursing program, but considered one of several indicators of students’
                            accomplishments in basic nursing.

                                students have 72 seconds per question, they have 90 minutes to complete the test.

                        <p>The Focused Review Tests are unproctored practice tests that students access at any time during
                        their enrollment in the Integrated Testing Program. These tests review basic nursing content 
                        according to the medical model and provide topical retesting opportunities. The tests are 
                        designed to coach students through the specific content, providing rationales for the correct 
                        and incorrect answers, comprehensive content remediation, and alternative question stems to 
                        enhance student comprehension of written questions.</p>
                        <p>The alternative wording of the question stem is called “Plain English for Nursing.” 
                        Kaplan partnered with a linguistic modification expert to reword all focused review tests to reduce 
                        unnecessary language complexity in our questions. This alternate form of the stem is available in the 
                        remediation phase after taking the test. To read more please see,

                        <p>Completing mid-fidelity simulations requires students to critically think and make clinical judgments. 
                        The Kaplan Integrated Testing Program includes six client simulations divided into modules. These modules 
                        are organized according to the steps of the nursing process and are designed to help students improve 
                        their critical thinking skills. The cases include the following:

                                Kaplan Nursing recognizes that there are certain behaviors required for making appropriate
                                clinical judgments. Students need to engage in the following behaviors while
                                completing the simulations:

                            <p>In each simulation, students are presented with a description of a client situation including 
                            a medical diagnosis. Students progress through care of the client using the modules organized by 
                            the nursing process framework. This makes it easy for students to identify strengths and weaknesses 
                            in prioritization and case management. Links to online learning resources are provided for additional 
                            study. The modules for each case study include the following:
